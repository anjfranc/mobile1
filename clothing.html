	<p> 
        Indian fashion has always been a hilight among all that India offers. With its unique and colorful designs, India's fashion has become something
        that many all over the world admire. Although there are many similiarities in fashion style across India, the various 
        states and regions of the country have developed their own  style that represents the culture and poeple of those in the particular 
        region.

        It should be noted that western culture has greatly influenced the fashion styles in Kerala. 
        As a result, both women and men do also wear jeans, t- shirts, and casual blouses in non-festive settings.

    In special settings and celebrations, women in Kerala wear an attire known as mundum neriyatum (pronounced muhn-duh neh-ree-ah-tuhm). 
    This is a set of two mundus with a lower garment around one’s waist like men wear and an upper mundu which is wrapped around one’s upper body and left hanging from a shoulder. 
    Women wear this upper mundu with a blouse.

            However, in casual settings such as in houses or when doing labor work, men wear a garment called lungis (pronounced loon-gees). Lungis 
            are worn around one's waist and are similar to mundus. The difference is that lungis are pieces of clothing that are more comfortable, casual, 
            and usually colorful with patterns.
